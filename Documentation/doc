1. Introduction
The Chrome Extension for Word Translation allows users to capture selected words on web pages and translate them using a backend API. This documentation provides an overview of the extension's code components, usage, and error handling.

2. Extension Components
The extension consists of several components:

2.1 Manifest File
The manifest.json file defines the extension's metadata, permissions, and components. It specifies the extension's name, version, and key components.

2.2 Popup HTML
The popup.html file is an HTML document that serves as the popup when the extension icon is clicked. It displays the selected word and translation result to the user.

2.3 Popup JavaScript
The popup.js file is responsible for capturing selected words, handling user interactions, and making network requests to the backend API for translation.

2.4 Content Script
The content.js file is a content script injected into active web pages. It captures selected words and sends them to the popup JavaScript for processing.

3. Usage
To use the extension:

Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the popup.
Select a word on a webpage using the mouse.
The selected word is displayed in the popup.
Click the "Translate" button to send a translation request to the backend API.
The translation result is displayed in the popup.
  
4. Error Handling
The extension includes basic error handling for network requests to the backend API:

If the network request fails (e.g., due to a network error or an invalid API response), an error message is displayed in the popup, and the error is logged to the browser's console.
